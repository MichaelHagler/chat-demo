<h3>Setting up Expo</h3>

  <li>
    Make sure your version of node is 16.xx.xx(expo only supports 16)
    You may have to use "nvm install 16.19.0" in your terminal then "nvm use 19.19.0" to make sure the correct version of node is used. IOS users need "nvm alias default 16.19.0" as their third command.
